# Testing

This document provides an overview of the testing strategy for the FutureTrack application.

## Existing Tests

The application has the default Laravel test files, but no custom tests have been implemented.

*   `tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`: A default feature test that asserts the application returns a successful response.
*   `tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php`: A default unit test that asserts that `true` is `true`.

## Coverage Gaps

*   **No Feature Tests**: There are no feature tests for any of the application's routes or features. This means there is no automated way to verify that the application is working as expected from a user's perspective.
*   **No Unit Tests**: There are no unit tests for any of the models, services, or other classes. This means there is no automated way to verify that individual components of the application are working correctly.
*   **No Frontend Tests**: There are no tests for the React components.

## Suggested Test Plan

1.  **Feature Tests (High Priority)**:
    *   Create feature tests for all authenticated routes to ensure they are accessible to logged-in users and inaccessible to guests.
    *   Write tests for all form submissions (e.g., updating a profile, submitting an assessment) to verify validation and data persistence.
    *   Test the core user flows, such as completing an assessment, setting a career goal, and updating roadmap progress.

2.  **Unit Tests (Medium Priority)**:
    *   Write unit tests for model relationships and helper methods.
    *   If service classes are introduced, write unit tests for the business logic they contain.
    *   Test any complex logic within controllers that is not covered by feature tests.

3.  **Frontend Tests (Low Priority)**:
    *   Implement component tests for key UI components using a library like Jest and React Testing Library.
    *   Consider end-to-end tests using a tool like Cypress or Playwright to test the application's frontend in a real browser.
